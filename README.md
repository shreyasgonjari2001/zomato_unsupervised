Zomato Restaurant Clustering using K-Means
This project focuses on analyzing and clustering restaurants listed in the Zomato dataset using the K-Means algorithm. The aim is to group similar restaurants based on key features, enabling better understanding of food trends and helping users or businesses make data-driven decisions.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Visualized distributions, ratings, and cuisine patterns

Identified trends across locations, cuisines, and price ranges

Clustering:

Applied K-Means algorithm on selected features (e.g., rating, cost, votes)

Used Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters

Visualized clusters to interpret similarities among restaurants

Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Outcome
This analysis highlights distinct restaurant groups and offers insights into customer preferences and pricing segments within the Zomato ecosystem.
